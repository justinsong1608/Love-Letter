            <h1>To Girl,</h1>
            <p>
                Where do I event start Janay... it's crazy how many years have gone by and I still get to call you my girl.
                We've been dating for over four years now and this is our fourth Valentines, pretty crazy huh. You should have left
                me by now LOLL since I haven't been the best boyfriend to you these past few months. There's so many things that I wish
                I can do for you. I wish I had lots of money so that I can buy you anything you want when shopping. I wish I had an 
                amazing body for you to drool over and treasue just like how I do to you HAHAHA. I wish I can be a better listener and
                someone that talks a lot. I wish I can just do ANYTHING for you. Hopefully, I can achieve all these wishes. You've been
                nothing but the best to me these past 4 years. You've been patient with me with during my job search, you've been spending money 
                on me when I can barely spend any for you, you've been patient with my lack of listening skills, you've been pushing me to be a 
                better version of myself not just for you but for me. The list can go on and on. What I'm trying to say is that Janay... you mean a lot to me. 
                Trust me when I say this. The day I get a job, I'm going to spoil the heck out of you. The day I get an amazing body, I'm 
                going to say "no" to you everytime you ask for sexy time because you're gonna beg. The day I become the better version of myself, 
                I hope you can be proud to call me your boy and brag about me. I love everything about you and there isn't anyone I'm willing to go
                to war other than you. Even if you try to push me away, even if you call me mean things, even if we might not get along at times, I 
                don't want anyone else to do those things but you. Hopefully, these next few months good things will come our way. Especially, content
                creation... you know what I mean. That would be pretty crazy if we can pop off and make that a career. Anyways hahaha, thank you
                for staying by my side these past 4.5 years. I love you so much that I bet you can't comprehend sometimes hahaha. I promise to continue
                to strive to be a better version of myself and make you the happiest cause YOU deserve to be happy. I love you, I love you, I love you Janay.
                Let's keep fighting for each other and one day when we're really really old, we can look back at all our memories and smile at them.
                Happy Valentines Janay :&#41;
